Bio--Filter
===========

Filters collection for bioinformatic tools.

Collection of tools for filtering information from long lists of results commonly generated by bioinformatics programs.

In CPAN, we know the BioPerl, a collection of tools (modules) to easy development of Perl scripts to bioinformatic.

Bioinformatics developer know that the list size of results from bioinformatic tools may be too long and with results that we don't need to nothing.

Let's to make easy filter a bioinformatics list results using the Perl language purpose.

Yes, I'd know that exist tools a lot in BioPerl to doing that, but let's to join all here, and make a simple, easy and wearable tools inside here.

We will give preference to tools exportable routines with clear and direct documentation.

Let's to doing this together, with a open source philosophy! Join us!
